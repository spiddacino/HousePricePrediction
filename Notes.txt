Average Sales Price:

This metric provides an average of property sale prices in a specific area over a period of time. It helps assess market trends and property values.
Days on Market (DOM):

DOM measures the number of days a property is listed for sale before it is sold. A lower DOM may indicate high demand in the market, while a higher DOM could suggest less demand or overpricing.
Occupancy Rate:

For rental properties, the occupancy rate reflects the percentage of units that are currently rented. A higher occupancy rate generally indicates a more stable income stream.
Location Factors:

Proximity to amenities, schools, transportation, and safety are crucial considerations affecting property values. The desirability of the location significantly influences real estate metrics.
